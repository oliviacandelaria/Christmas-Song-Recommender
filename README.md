# Christmas Song Recommender
This project is a recommender system that generates Christmas song recommendations based on a user's liked songs playlist. Built using the Spotify API, the system analyzes musical features of the user's favorite tracks and suggests holiday songs with similar characteristics. The system retrieves a user's liked songs from Spotify, analyzes their audio features, and compares them with a curated database of Christmas songs to generate personalized holiday music recommendations.

This project was completed for the Statistical Data Science (PSTAT 134) course at UCSB.
